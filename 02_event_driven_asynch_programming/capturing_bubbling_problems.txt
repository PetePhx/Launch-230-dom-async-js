Capturing and Bubbling (2)

Now that we have seen how the concept of capturing and bubbling goes with event listeners and event objects, we'll work on practice problems to help cement our understanding of it. Each practice problem has a code snippet and short clip. Your objective is to list the sequence of event listeners that fire based on the alert boxes you see in the clip (i.e., click event listener of the main element listening on the capture phase).

1. Two click event listeners on `div` (#elem1) listening on the bubbling phase. One alerts the tag name of the target element (clicked element), the second one alerting the tag name of the currentTarget (div) element.


2. Two event listeners on `div` (#elem1). The first one is listening on the capture phase, alerting "capturing" and the second one listening on the bubbling phase, alerting "bubbling".


3. Two event listeners both listening on the bubbling phase, each firing twice:

1) the mouse 'click' event listener on the `div` element (#elem1) alerting the tag name of the target element after a 7-second time-out ('DIV').

2) the keyboard 'keypress' event listener on the `document` object, which alerts the event code after a 7-second timeout (keyQ).

3) the keyboard 'keypress' event listener on the `document` object, which alerts the event code after a 7-second timeout (keyW).

4) the mouse 'click' event listener on the `div` element (#elem1) alerting the tag name of the target element after a 7-second time-out ('MAIN').
